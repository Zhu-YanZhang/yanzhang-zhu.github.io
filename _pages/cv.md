<div><span style="float:right"><em>Kunshan, China</em></span><em>Advisor: Dr. Myung-Joong Hwang</em></div>
  
* Studied the driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model with one-photon and two-photon loss, and found its phase diagram.
* Studied the working mechanism of critical Schrodinger cat qubit
* Exploring the possibility of constructing decoherence-free subspace with open Rabi model with two-photon loss.
