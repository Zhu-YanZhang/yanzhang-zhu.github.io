<div><span style="float:right"><em>Kunshan, China</em></span><em>Advisor: Dr. Myung-Joong Hwang</em></div>
  
* Studied the driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model with one-photon and two-photon loss, and found its phase diagram.
* Studied the working mechanism of critical Schrodinger cat qubit
* Exploring the possibility of constructing decoherence-free subspace with open Rabi model with two-photon loss.

* Studied the relationship between gas separation rate and sizes of molecular sieve molecules and pores, with dual control volume grand canonical molecular dynamics (DCV-GCMD) method.
* Discovered a back reflection function considering the effects of surface roughness on diffusivity of monotonic and diatomic gas particles, and extend the hindered diffusion law to a wider range of application.
